                    the `Desired`state of a device property and this configuration
                    update is pushed to the edge node. The mapper sends a command
                    to the device to change this property value as per the desired
                    state . It receives the `Reported` state of the property once
                    the previous operation is complete and sends the reported state
                    to the cloud. Offline device interaction in the edge is possible
                    via twin properties for control/command operations.

                        of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing
                        its usage when embedded in APIs.  1. Ignored fields.  It includes
                        many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance,
                        ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in
                        actual usage.  2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to
                        add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded
                        usages, there are particular     restrictions like, \"must
                        refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name
                        must be restricted\".     Those cannot be well described when
                        embedded.  3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                        are different, the validation rules are different by usage,
                        which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                        \ 4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind
                        is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        \    during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In
                        most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        \    and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.  5.
                        We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded
                        in many locations, updates to this type     will affect numerous
                        schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API
